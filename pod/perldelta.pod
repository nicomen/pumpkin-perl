=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.35.2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.35.1 release and the 5.35.2
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.35.0, first read
L<perl5351delta>, which describes differences between 5.35.0 and 5.35.1.




=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

The list of new and updated modules is modified automatically as part of
preparing a Perl release, so the only reason to manually add entries here is if
you're summarising the important changes in the module update. (Also, if the
manually-added details don't match the automatically-generated ones, the
release manager will have to investigate the situation carefully.)

[ Within each section, list entries as an =item entry ]

=head2 Updated Modules and Pragmata

=item *

C<perl5db.pl> has been upgraded from version 1.60 to 1.61.

The C<v> command works again, and now has some tests.

=head1 Documentation

=head2 Changes to Existing Documentation

=head3 L<perlintro>

=over 4

=item *

A number of sentences in L<perlintro> have been simplified,
to make things clearer.
Ambiguities were resolved, related to "special variables".

=back


=head1 Platform Support

The :win32 IO layer has been removed. This experimental replacement for the
:unix layer never reached maturity in its nearly two decades of existence.

=head1 Internal Changes

=over 4

=item *

The API constant formerly named C<G_ARRAY>, indicating list context, has now
been renamed to a more accurate C<G_LIST>.  A compatibilty macro C<G_ARRAY> has
been added to allow existing code to work unaffected.  New code should be
written using the new constant instead.  This is supported by C<Devel::PPPort>
version 3.63.

=item *

XXX

=item *

The definition for the C<ASSUME()> macro, broken on Windows in 5.34, has
been fixed.

=back

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

The flags on the OPTVAL parameter to setsockopt() were previously
checked before magic was called, possibly treating a numeric value as
a packed buffer or vice versa.  It also ignored the UTF-8 flag,
potentially treating the internal representation of an upgraded SV as
the bytes to supply to the setsockopt() system call.  (github #18660)

=item *

Only set IOKp, not IOK on $) and $(.
This was issue #18955: This will prevent serializers from serializing these
variables as numbers (which loses the additional groups).
This restores behaviour from 5.16

=head1 Acknowledgements

Perl 5.35.2 represents approximately 5 weeks of development since Perl
5.35.1 and contains approximately 27,000 lines of changes across 420 files
from 25 authors.

Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were
approximately 14,000 lines of changes to 200 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant
community of users and developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.35.2:

Atsushi Sugawara, Ben Cornett, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Christian Walde
(Mithaldu), Craig A. Berry, David Golden, David Marshall, Felipe Gasper,
Jakub Wilk, James E Keenan, Karl Williamson, Leam Hall, Leon Timmermans, Max
Maischein, Neil Bowers, Nicholas Clark, Paul Evans, Paul Marquess, Richard
Leach, Sawyer X, Sergey Poznyakoff, Sven Kirmess, Thibault Duponchelle, Todd
Rinaldo, Tony Cook.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to
the Perl bug tracker.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please open an issue at
L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
tiny but sufficient test case.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a public issue tracker, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.

=head1 Give Thanks
