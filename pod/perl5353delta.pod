=head1 NAME

perl5353delta - what is new for perl v5.35.3

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.35.2 release and the 5.35.3
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.35.1, first read
L<perl5352delta>, which describes differences between 5.35.1 and 5.35.2.

=head1 Notice

With this release, the experimental C<switch> feature, present in every feature
bundle since they were introduced in v5.10, has been removed from the v5.36
bundle.  If you want to live dangerously and use it, you'll have to enable it
explicitly.

=head1 Core Enhancements

All warnings are enabled automatically within the scope of
a C<L<use v5.35|perlfunc/use VERSION>> (or higher) declaration.

This document provides the process for administering an election or vote
within the Perl Core Team.

=head2 Changes to Existing Documentation

We have attempted to update the documentation to reflect the changes
listed in this document.  If you find any we have missed, open an issue
at L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.

Additionally, the following selected changes have been made:

=head3 L<perlop>

=item *

now notes that an invocant only needs to be an object or class name
for method calls, not for subroutine references.

=back

=head3 L<perlexperiment>

=over 4

=item *

notes the C<:win32> IO pseudolayer is removed (this happened in 5.35.2).

=back

=head3 L<perldeprecation>

=over 4

=item *

notes the new location for functions moved from L<Pod::Html> to
L<Pod::Html::Util> that are no longer intended to be used outside of core.

=head1 Configuration and Compilation

=over 4

=item *

The makedepend step is now run in parallel by using make

This reduces the time for

  time sh ./makedepend MAKE=make cflags

from 5 seconds to 2 seconds with MAKEFLAGS=-j8

=item *

F<Configure> now tests whether C<< #include <xlocale.h> >> is required
to use the POSIX 1003 thread-safe locale functions or some related
extensions.  This prevents problems where a non-public F<xlocale.h> is
removed in a library update, or F<xlocale.h> isn't intended for public
use. (github L<#18936|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/18936>)

=back

=head1 Internal Changes

=over 4

=item *

Macros have been added to F<perl.h> to facilitate version comparisons:
C<PERL_GCC_VERSION_GE>, C<PERL_GCC_VERSION_GT>, C<PERL_GCC_VERSION_LE> and
C<PERL_GCC_VERSION_LT>.

Inline functions have been added to F<embed.h> to determine the position of
the least significant 1 bit in a word: C<lsbit_pos32> and C<lsbit_pos64>.

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

Use of the C<mktables> debugging facility would cause perl to croak since
v5.31.10; this problem has now been fixed.

=item *

C<makedepend> logic is now compatible with BSD make (fixes
L<GH #19046|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19046>).

=head1 Errata From Previous Releases

=item *

L<perl5300delta> mistakenly identified a CVE whose correct identification is CVE-2015-1592.

the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to
the Perl bug tracker.

included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please open an issue at
L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
tiny but sufficient test case.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a public issue tracker, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.

=head1 Give Thanks

If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5,
you can do so by running the C<perlthanks> program:
